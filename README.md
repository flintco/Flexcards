# Flexcards

Flexcards started out as a project for a business pitch competition called [Transcend UW](https://www.transcenduw.com). My partner Ben and I spent many months going through the Transcend program culminating with our final presentation on pitch day. In the end, we won "Best Pitch" and were given money to further test our idea.
